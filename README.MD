# Formula One info

This project is a simple example of using Blazor WebAssembly (WASM) to display information about circuits and drivers. The goal is to practice web development with Blazor WASM, a framework that allows building single-page web applications with C# and .NET .

The project uses the [API Sports](https://api-sports.io/) API to fetch data about circuits and drivers, and the [Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit) library to simplify the API requests.

The project has a page called Circuits that lists all the circuits, a page that shows the details of a circuit, and a modal that displays the information of a driver who has achieved the best lap on that circuit.

The project structure is based on the [Common web application architecture](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/modern-web-apps-azure/common-web-application-architectures), which provides a clean and modular organization for web applications, even though this project is very simple.
